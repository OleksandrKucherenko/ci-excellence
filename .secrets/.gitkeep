# This directory stores private encryption keys
# NEVER commit the actual key files to git!
#
# Files in this directory:
# - mise-age.txt      - Private age key (NEVER COMMIT! - contains public key too)
#
# Note: The private key file contains both the private and public keys.
# The public key can be extracted from it.
#
# The .gitignore is configured to exclude all files in .secrets/
# except this .gitkeep file.
