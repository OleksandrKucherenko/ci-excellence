let's review the file @.github/workflows/release.yml

Assumptions:
- we are following SEMVER 2.0 standard in versioning (https://semver.org/)
- version tag followes pattern: `[path/]v{SEMVER}` where `[path/]` is optional and represent the sub-folder path in the repository, for project root it is empty

```
<valid semver> ::= <version core>
                 | <version core> "-" <pre-release>
                 | <version core> "+" <build>
                 | <version core> "-" <pre-release> "+" <build>

<version core> ::= <major> "." <minor> "." <patch>
```

- Use BUN and Typescript/Javascript ecosystem tools as helper when needed (avoid python). 
- Use Github API (or GH CLI) to get information about the commit, PR, etc.
- Use Github Actions API (or GH CLI) to get information about the pipeline, etc.
- Use Github Actions API (or GH CLI) to trigger pipeline.
- we should work for simple repositories as well as for monorepos

Goals:
1. be possible to trigger release cycle/loop/workflow/pipeline by:
   - assigned git tag `[path/]v{SEMVER}`
   - manual triggering:
     - release type increment (major, minor, patch)
     - release type modifier: pre-release (we support only those three types: alpha, beta, rc)
     - release type modifier: pre-release iteration (alpha.1, alpha.2, ..., beta.1, beta.2, ..., rc.1, rc.2, ...)
     - release type modifier: build (git sha short commit hash or user provided number)
   - webhook tiggered (repeats manual triggering, but gives some automation api)
2. pipeline should publish summary report in logs, in PR comment and in github actions CI summary
   1. summary should be published only once per PR as a comment, any changes will simply replace the PR comment
   2. PR comment should contain hash of the commit to which it is attached
   3. summary should contain one-click links that activates different actions:
      1. deploy to staging
      2. deploy to production
      3. (for pre-release) promote to release version
      4. (for pre-release) promote to -alpha[.NN], -beta[.NN], -rc[.NN]
      5. mark as stable
      6. mark as unstable
      7. mark as deprecated
3. Manual steps triggering actually should only help to assign a git tag in proper format to the commit, and that should re-trigger the pipeline via `push tags` event
4. Tags can be re-assigned to another commit, if they exists already
5. publish-* tasks can skip itself it they detect that the version is already published (if user provide a FORCED parameter, it can try to re-publish the version if registry allows it, otherwise print a warning and skip itself)
